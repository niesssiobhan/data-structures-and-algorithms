### Modules
#### `graph.js`
##### Challenge
* AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
* AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
* GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
* Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
### Graphs
* I was able to follow along with the methods taught in class 
* For each of the methods I would believe that the Big O would be O(1)

## API
* AddNode() this will add a node to the graph and then return the value 
* AddEdge() this will add on an edge between the nodes (this can include weight)
* GetNodes() this wil return all nodes as a collection
* GetNeighbors() this will return a list of all nodes connected to the node that was given
* GetSize() this will return the number of nodes that are in the graph

#### Tests
* How do you run tests?
npm test
* What assertions were made?
* What assertions need to be / should be made?
