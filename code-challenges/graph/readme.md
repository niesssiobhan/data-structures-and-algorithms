## Graphs

### Author: Siobhan Niess

### Links and Resources
* [repo]()
* [travis]()

### Modules
#### `graph.js`
##### Challenge
* AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
* AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
* GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
* Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
### Graphs

## API

#### Tests
* How do you run tests?
npm test
* What assertions were made?
* What assertions need to be / should be made?
