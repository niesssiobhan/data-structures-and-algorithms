# Binary Shift 
This takes in two parameters which are the sorted array and the search key itself. To find the key within the array, if it is in the array or not. Checking the index position in the array and searching from center to start and from center to end.

## Challenge 
The problem domain for this challenge is to write a function with two parameters, the sorted array and the given integer. You are to search through the array and find if the given integer matched an index position within the array. The function should then return the index position though if the given integer does not exist within the array you will get a retrun of -1. 

## Approach and Efficiency
The approach that we took for this was to write everything out on the writeboard. We wrote out the algorithm for the problem, the code that we planned on writing, went went through the verification, the problem domain, and then the visual to the problem. We wrote it all out on the whiteboard to get a good visual on what steps we needed to make and how to execute the problem. Went through the verification to find any possible bugs.
