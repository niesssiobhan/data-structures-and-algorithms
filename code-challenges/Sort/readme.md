* [travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/niesssiobhan/data-structures-and-algorithms)

### Modules
#### `merge-sort.js`
##### Challenge
* Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.
#### `quick-sort.js`
##### Challenge
* Write a function that accepts an array of integers, and returns an array sorted by a recursive quicksort algorithm.
#### `radix-sort.js`
##### Challenge
* Write a function that accepts an array of positive integers, and returns an array sorted by a radix sort algorithm.

## Approach & Efficiency
* mergeSort
  * My approach to this was some research
  * Th Big O for this was 0(n) for both time and space
* quickSort
  * My approach to this was collaboration and researc, and reviewing back to yesterdays challenge
  * The Big O for this was O(n * logn)
* radixSort
  * My approach to this was collaboration, using buckets, and research
  * The Big O for time is O(b * (n+b)) and the Big O for space is O(n+b)

#### Tests
* How do you run tests?
npm test
* What assertions were made?
* What assertions need to be / should be made?

#### Collaborators
* Brent
* Becca
