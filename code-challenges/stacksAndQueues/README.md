### Modules
#### `stacks-and-queues.js`
##### Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
Create a Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty queue when instantiated.
#### `queue-with-stacks.js`
##### Challenge 
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement the standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods: enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
