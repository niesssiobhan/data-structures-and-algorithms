# Reverse an Aarray
Reverse an Array is exactly how it sounds, the objective is to take a given array and reverse its order.

## Challenge 
This code challenge is that you are given an array and you need to write code so that the return is the same arrray originally given but it is in reverse. Also to make sure that we keep in mind of edge cases. Write and include in our code if you are given something other than an array, empty, or there are no parameters. 

## Approach and Efficiency
The approach that we took for this was to write everythign out on the writeboard. We wrote out the algorithm for the problem, the code that we planned on writing, the psedo code, went went through the verification, the problem domain, and then the visual to the problem. We wrote it all out on the whiteboard to get a good visual on what steps we needed to make and how to execute the problem.
